  “cu” is a separator, and there must be a sumti before the selbri that needs to be kept separate for “cu” to be used. With no sumti preceding the selbri, “cu” is not permitted.
  
  Short words like “cu” which serve grammatical functions are called “cmavo” in Lojban. 

  “se”, “te”, “ve”, and “xe” cmavo are said to convert the selbri.

  In Lojban, the converted selbri has a new place structure that is renumbered to reflect the place reversal, thus having effects when such a conversion is used in combination with other constructs such as “le selbri [ku]”

  The cmavo “ni'o” separates paragraphs
  In a long text or utterance, the topical structure of the text may be indicated by multiple “ni'o”s, with perhaps “ni'oni'oni'o” used to indicate a chapter, “ni'oni'o” to indicate a section, and a single “ni'o” to indicate a subtopic corresponding to a single English paragraph.
  The cmavo “.i” separates sentences

- tanru
  The place structure of a tanru is always that of the final component of the tanru.
  The meaning of a tanru is determined by the literal meaning of its components, and not by any connotations or figurative meanings.

  The description sumti “le tavla ku” means “the talker”, and may be used wherever any sumti may be used.
  10.4)  le sutra tavla
       The fast talker

  10.5)  le sutra cu tavla
       The fast one is talking.
      
  A word which may by itself express a selbri relation is called a “brivla”.
  The three types of brivla are
  gismu (root words),
  lujvo (compounds),
  fu'ivla (borrowings from other languages).
  Some cmavo may also serve as selbri, acting as variables that stand for another selbri. The most commonly used of these is “go'i”, which represents the main bridi of the previous Lojban sentence, with any new sumti or other sentence features being expressed replacing the previously expressed ones. 

  12.3)  di'u [cu] pluka mi
       This (the last sentence) pleases me (perhaps because it is grammatical or sounds nice).
  12.4)  la'e di'u [cu] pluka mi
       This (the meaning of the last sentence; i.e. that the dog is beautiful) pleases me.

  A simple means of expressing possession, however, is to place a sumti representing the possessor of an object within the description sumti that refers to the object
  13.1)  le mi gerku cu sutra

  doi x => hey, x
  coi = hello
  co'o = goodbye
  ko = you in commands, replaces any sumti

  ko kurji ko = take care of yourself

  ma = like ko but a question
  The cmavo “mo” is the selbri analogue of “ma”.
  The cmavo “xu”, when placed in front of a bridi, asks whether that bridi is true as stated. 
  xu do tavla mi
  The answer “Yes” may be given by simply restating the bridi without the “xu” question word. Lojban has a shorthand for doing this with the word “go'i” 
  Instead of a negative answer, the bridi may be restated in such a way as to make it true. If this can be done by substituting sumti, it may be done with “go'i” as well. 
  A general negative answer may be given by “na go'i”.

  Indicators
  ==========
  
  Attitudinal indicators
  ----------------------
  Grammatically they are very simple: one or more attitudinals at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire bridi; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the left.
  16.1)  .ie mi [cu] klama
       Agreement! I go.
  
  16.2)  .ei mi [cu] klama
       Obligation! I go.

  16.3)  mi [cu] klama le melbi .ui [ku]
       I go to the beautiful-thing (and I am happy because it is the beautiful thing I’m going to).

  Discursives
  -----------
  Another group of cmavo with the same grammatical rules as attitudinal indicators, allow free expression of certain kinds of commentary about the main utterances.
  ji'a = additionally,
  ku'i = however,
  16.4)  mi [cu] klama .i do [cu] stali
       I go.  You stay.

  16.5)  mi [cu] klama .i ji'a do [cu] stali
       I go.  In addition, you stay.  (added weight)

  16.6)  mi [cu] klama .i ku'i do [cu] stali
       I go.  However, you stay.  (contrast)

  Evidentials
  -----------
  Show the speaker’s relationship to the statement, specifically how the speaker came to make the statement. These include “za'a” (I directly observe the relationship), “pe'i” (I believe that the relationship holds), “ru'a” (I postulate the relationship), and others.
  16.7)  pe'i do [cu] melbi
       I opine!  You are beautiful.

  16.8)  za'a do [cu] melbi
       I directly observe!  You are beautiful.


  The tag “pu” forces the sentence to refer to a time in the past.
  ca => present
  pu => past
  ba => future
  vu => far away (Lojban also extends the notion of “tense” to refer not only to time but to space.)
  vi => nearby
  Tags used in this way always appear at the very beginning of the selbri, just after the “cu”, and they may make a “cu” unnecessary, since tags cannot be absorbed into tanru. 

  rafsi: a word fragment; one or more is associated with each gismu; can be assembled according to rules in order to make lujvo; not a valid word by itself.
  selma'o: a group of cmavo that have the same grammatical use (can appear interchangeably in sentences, as far as the grammar is concerned) but differ in meaning or other usage.
