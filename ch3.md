The alphabetic order given above is that of the ASCII coded character set, widely used in computers.

. is a proper harsh syllabic separator
' is a proper lax syllabic separator
, is a morphing syllabic separator

Any vowel pairs containing i and/or u are diphtongs, except
yi
eu
ou
yu
i becomes j and u becomes w.
If both vowels are conversion candidates, only convert the first.

The four syllabic consonants [m, n, l, r] can all be used as syllables in and by themselves, but this is only ever used in Lojbanized words and not in the core language.

When more than two vowels occur together in Lojban, the normal pronunciation pairs vowels from the left into syllables, as in the Lojbanized name:
5.1)   meiin.
       mei,in.

consonant pairs
---------------
- no doubles
- no voiced/unvoiced mixes
- no mix of polish characters (c, s, z, j)
- x can not be paired with c or k
- mz is bad too (Sorry James - you are djeimyz)

Initial consonant pairs are a clusterfuck.. Let's not really learn them for now.

consonant triples
-----------------
- The first two consonants must constitute a permissible consonant pair;
- The last two consonants must constitute a permissible initial consonant pair;
- The triples “ndj”, “ndz”, “ntc”, and “nts” are forbidden.

Buffering: the act of throwing additional vowels under the bus.

Always stress the next-to-last syllable, except when noted otherwise with capital letters.
